      you will be able to use specific tags on your notes that will
      execute their associated functionality.';

$lang['faq_answer_6'] = 'If you don’t have internet connection, Evernote® won’t be able to sync your notes,
      so they won’t be able to notify us with your requests.
      The good thing is that Evernote® will automatically sync your notes whenever
      an internet connection is available. At that moment,
      we will be able to process your requests.
      <br>Look it this way, we offer you the possibility to get work done in advance,
      forgetting about internet connection and knowing that your requests will be
      processed whenever you go back online!';

            We only store your Evernote® user id’s, your notes id’s,
            the date when we receive the request and if there were changes on your note.';

            <br>There are some additional configurations to make in some of the tags.
            If you use one of these tags and you haven’t configured it,
            we won’t be able to process it.

            There is no problem. From that moment on, we won’t respond to your action tag requests.
            <br>To completely unlink your Evernote® account with our service,
            you will have to access to your Evernote® account and revoke the access to our application.
            <br>
            You can also revoke the access to our application without having to delete your account on EATtags.
            This way we won’t receive any request notifications, and we won’t be able to access your Evernote® account.';
