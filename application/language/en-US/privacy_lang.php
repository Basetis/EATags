            Thecnology &amp; Information Services S.L. (BaseTIS) values the
            privacy of those who use our web site, products and services and
            makes all commercially reasonable efforts to protect it. This Privacy
            Policy covers the collection, use and disclosure of personal
            information that may be collected any time you interact with Ever
            Action Tags (EATags), such as when you visit our web site, use or
            purchase our products and services, or communicate with EATags
            employees. Please read the following to learn more about what
            information we collect, what we do with that information, and how we
            may use your personal information.</p>
            <P>
            <h3>Information
            Collection and Use</h3>
            <P>
                The
            primary reason that we collect certain personal information is to
            provide the best possible level of customer service. It enables us to
            deliver product announcements, software updates and special offers as
            well as provide convenient and personalized user access and improve
            the features and usability of our products. Registered EATags users
            can view and change their personal information at any time by
            visiting the EATags account information page by signing in at
            www.eatags.com and clicking on the &ldquo;Account&rdquo; link.
            Unregistered users may still be able to use certain EATags web sites
            and services, in which case no personal information is collected.    </p>
            <p>
                BaseTIS
            may collect information and use it for internal business purposes in
            a number of situations, for example:    </p>
            <UL>
              <LI><p>
                  Personal

              EATags products and services you use;    </p>
              <LI><p>
                  Demographic
              information such as your occupation and where you use your computer
              and mobile devices &mdash; to improve our understanding of our
              customer needs;    </p>

              information about your visit from the browser or EATags application
              on your computer or mobile device, including IP address, cookies and
              the pages you request &mdash; to analyze trends, administer the
              site, track your navigation of the site, deliver relevant
              advertisements and gather broad demographic information for
              aggregate use (note that IP addresses are not linked to &ldquo;personally
              identifiable information&rdquo;); and    </p>
              <LI><p>
                  Aggregate
              information from multiple users without personally identifying
              individuals, such as geographic region, which we may share with our
              business partners &mdash; to improve understanding of customer needs
              and provide relevant services.    </p>
            </UL>
            <p>
                You
            may elect to terminate your participation in the services at any time
            and/or delete information you save on EATags features. If you cancel
            your account, or delete any feature or feature content, it will no
            longer be accessible to you or others who may access the service, but
            there may continue to be residual copies of such information due to
            the nature of the computer system&rsquo;s operation and ongoing data
            back-up and archiving.    </p>
            <p>
                You
            may also change your contact preferences after logging into your
            EATags account at www.eatags.com and going to Account information. If
            you wish to opt out of email marketing communications from us, you
            may click the &ldquo;unsubscribe&rdquo; link at the bottom of an
            email message you receive from us.    </p>

            <p>
                The
            EATags web site allows you to create an &ldquo;EATags Username&rdquo;
            based on your personal information. This is required in order to take
            full advantage of the EATags services. It also allows EATags to
            provide more personalized and convenient service and saves time when
            you want to use the EATags services, update your software or
            settings, or search for EATags-related information.    </p>

               Cookies
            and Tracking Pixels   </h3>
            <p>
                Cookies
            are small data files that a web site you visit may save on your hard
            drive that usually includes an anonymous unique identifier. A cookie
            cannot retrieve any other data from your hard drive, pass on computer
            viruses, or capture your e-mail address. The EATags web site uses
            cookies for user authentication, keeping track of your preferences,
            promotional campaigns that require user identification, keeping track
            of our audience size and traffic patterns, and in certain other
            cases. We may include tracking pixels, which are small graphic
            images, in our email messages and newsletters to determine whether
            the messages were opened and the links were actually viewed.    </p>
            <p>
                You
            can configure your browser to accept cookies, reject cookies or
            notify you when a cookie is being used. However, if you configure
            your browser to reject cookies, you may not be able to use EATags
            services that require you to sign in or take advantage of all the
            features of EATags. If you do not want to receive tracking pixels,
            you will need to disable HTML images in your email client, but that
            may affect your ability to view images in other email that you
            receive.    </p>
            <p>
                EATags
            may allow third party business partners that display advertisements
            on some of our web pages to maintain their own cookies on your
            computer. These business partners do not have access to EATags&rsquo;
            cookies and their use is subject to their own privacy policies.    </p>

                EATags
            is committed to protecting the security of your information and takes
            reasonable precautions to protect it. However, Internet data
            transmissions, whether wired or wireless, cannot be guaranteed to be
            100% secure and as a result we cannot ensure the security of
            information you transmit to us; accordingly, you acknowledge that you
            do so at your own risk. Once we receive your data transmission, we
            make all commercially reasonable efforts to ensure its security on
            our systems:    </p>
            <UL>
              <LI><p>
                  Your
              EATags password is protected by encryption and only you have access

              <LI><p>
                  Your
              personal information and data stored in our systems is protected by
              various physical, electronic and procedural safeguards. It is housed
              in a secure facility and EATags restricts physical and network
              access to this facility to select trained staff and regularly
              evaluates its technologies, facilities, procedures and potential
              risks to maintain the security and privacy of our users&rsquo; data.
              As a rule, EATags employees do not monitor or view your personal
              information or content stored in the EATags service, but it may be
              viewed if we learn that our Terms of Service may have been violated
              and confirmation is required, or we otherwise determine that we have
              an obligation to review it; and    </p>
              <LI><p>
                  Certain
              EATags services support the use of standard SSL encryption to
              protect data transmissions. However, this is not a guarantee that
              such data transmissions cannot be accessed, altered or deleted due
              to firewall or other security software failures.    </p>

            <p>
                If
            EATags learns of a security system breach we may attempt to notify
            you and provide information on protective steps, if available,
            through the e-mail address that you supplied during registration or
            posting a notice on our web site. Depending on where you live, you
            may have a legal right to receive such notices in writing.    </p>

            complies with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Children&rsquo;s

            We will not knowingly collect personal information relating to
            children under 13 years of age, and if we learn that we have
